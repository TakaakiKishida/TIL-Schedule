## Academic Integrity: ##

I do not tolerate academic misconduct, [and neither does the University of Oklahoma](http://integrity.ou.edu/files/nine_things_you_should_know.pdf). I will not hesitate to fail students who do not fully comply with the University's academic misconduct policy. If you find yourself contemplating cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic misconduct, please come see me first. Help is available if you are struggling. I want everyone in the class to try their best and to do their own work. Please be advised that I reserve the right to utilize anti-plagiarism resources such as TurnItIn when grading assignments.

## Reasonable Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: ##

If a student requires an accommodation based on disability, the student should meet with me in my office during the first week of the semester. Student responsibility primarily rests with informing faculty at the beginning of the semester and in providing authorized documentation through designated administrative channels. The Disability Resource Center is located in Goddard Hall (405-325-3852).
